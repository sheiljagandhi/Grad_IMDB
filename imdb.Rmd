## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
setwd("C:Users/sheiljagandhi/Desktop/MSDA/Data_Visualization_Project/imdb_files")
```

```{r}
Top250 = read.csv('IMDB_Top250Engmovies2_OMDB_Detailed.csv')
head(Top250)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = IMDB, aes(x = CriticRating, y = AudienceRating, colour = Genre, size = BudgetInMillions )) + geom_point()

```
